We illustrate the proposed approach for a two-user multi-access broadcast channel with a guaranteed performance bound, converging to zero exponentially. At every time instant, binary packets are arrived with unknown probability distributions at the users. The users are interested  to  maximize their throughput over a shared medium whereas they do not know whether or not the other user has a packet.

The objective is to  find  the  optimal  frequency for  transmitting the state of the battery  under a transmission cost.  Due to the imperfectness of the observation process at  the decision making level,  planning in  the conventional belief space is difficult. Also,   RL in   belief space is conceptually challenging because  the dynamics of  the belief state depends on the model. To overcome these shortcomings, we  introduce a new planning space equipped with a pseudo state to develop a near-optimal strategy.

Consequently, it is of vital interest to be able to optimize the performance of the grid by designing collaborative strategies between the components.

			       <p align="justify">  In this project, we investigate a soft-constrained minmax control problem of a leader-follower network. The network consists of one leader and an arbitrary number of followers that wish to reach consensus with minimum energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances.  A social welfare cost function is defined, and it is shown that a unique saddle-point strategy exists which minimizes the worst-case value of the cost function. The solution is obtained by two scalable Riccati equations, which depend on a prescribed attenuation parameter, serving as a robustness factor. For the intermittent mean-field sharing information structure, an approximate saddle-point strategy is proposed, and its converges to the saddle-point is analyzed.

The product is distributed to the consumers through a number of distributors (hubs), each of which has its own operating capacity. The objective is to find a risk-sensitive solution for the supplier and distributors such that the delivered product is as close as possible to the supplier’s production level while the distributors’ demands are fulfilled. A closed-form low-complexity representation of the globally optimal strategy is obtained, whose computational complexity is independent of the number of distributors. In addition, it is shown that the risk-sensitive solution converges to the risk-neutral one as the number of decision makers increases to infinity.

			       <p align="justify">We invetigate the effect of reciprocal behaviour of people in a society in response to low and high job-hiring seasons. It is observed that in the introduced reciprocal equilibrium, every unemployed individual exhibits an intuitive behavior, which is to be greedy all the time in order to find a job. However, employed individuals display a more sophisticated behavior. More precisely, when the anxiety factor is low, people tend to care about the well-being of the society and choose to be kind until a certain threshold. After this threshold,  people become more and more greedy and less and less kind, as the anxiety factor increases. Another interesting observation is that people tend to be  opportunistic (i.e., greedy) as the hiring season approaches its end. This is due to the fact that everyone knows that the chance of getting a job is going to drop.

            <div  ID="myDIV11" style="display: block;">
			       <p align="justify">
			       	An important question that often arises in the operation of networked systems is whether to collect the realtime data or to estimate them based on the previously collected data. Various factors should be taken into account such as how informative the data are at each time instant for state estimation, how costly and credible the collected data are, and how rapidly the data vary with time.   Based on a novel planning space, a Bellman equation is proposed to identify a near-optimal strategy whose computational complexity is logarithmic with respect to the inverse of the desired maximum distance from the optimal solution, and polynomial with respect to the number of nodes. For the special case of linear dynamics, a separation principle is constructed wherein the optimal estimate is computed by a Kalman-like filter, irrespective of the probability distribution of random variables. It is shown that the complexity of finding the proposed sampling strategy, in this special case, is independent of the size of the state space and the number of nodes. For more details, see  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03963.pdf">article</a>.

            <div  ID="myDIV12" style="display: block;">
			       <p align="justify"> We propose a stochastic dynamic control strategy to prevent the spread of an infection over a homogeneous network. The infectious process is persistent, i.e., it continues to contaminate the network once it is established. It is assumed that there is a finite set of network management options available such as degrees of nodes and promotional plans to minimize the number of infected nodes while taking the implementation cost into account. Borrowing some techniques from mean-field team theory the optimal strategy is obtained by using dynamic programming decomposition and the convolution of some binomial probability mass functions. For infinite-population networks, the optimal solution is described by a Bellman equation. For more details, see  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00232.pdf">article</a>.
